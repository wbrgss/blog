title: The sexual convolution
subtitle: The best things in life are free?

The sexual revolution of the 1960s was supposedly an era of free love. But, according to the millenial media, its contemporary equivalent—hookup culture—is [decidedly loveless](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating). The two terms describe essentially the same "trend" of promiscuity (or sexual liberation, to give it an ideological spin). Yet while free love connotes silly, slutty bohemians engaged in harmless rebellion, "hookup culture" shares the same negative space as its evil twin, "rape culture," or even "consumer culture" and "gun culture." At face value, such vitriolic phrases evoke bacteria more than civil society (civilization?).

In two generations, sexual freedom has come full circle. Millenials, much like their parents, convince themselves that detached sex works for them. Its upsides include freedom, choice, and potentially steamy encounters--at the expense of security, love, and the likelihood of lukewarm ones. Unlike the first sexual revolution, however, modern sexual relationships are better described as a devolution; a collective shug that casually accepts casual relationships. 

The boomers' liberal sexual attitudes brought us STDs and divorce, and a sex culture that mercilessly exploited young women ~(at least today, such exploitation is prettily packaged as empowering)~. But at least it had a purpose. More ideaologically-minded hippies were fucking each other and the system at the same time; forcing a cultural shift that rejected the repressive gender roles and stifiling societal expectations of the 1950s. Their more libertine peers were, at the very least, pursued an lifestyle that combined hedonism with optimism. They saw the stable but boring lives of their parents and asked themselves "is this it"?

The same question is now being asked by the baby boomers' babies, who are of course the natural consequences of all their lovemaking. Their ennui is now caused by abundance of choice, rather than the restrictive society their parents fought against. That, and apathy so pervasive that not only they have to worry about catching STDs, but feelings as well. The only way to prevent such an affliction is emotional detachment.

Cold-heartnedness is the number one difference between the free love movement, which at least aspired to reject it, and what its contemporary equivalent nonchalantly embraces. Despite moral panic over wayward millenials, they actually have fewer sexual partners, overall, than their parents {% sidenote %}. They also have fewer marriages, higher divorce rates, and etc doom and gloom.
