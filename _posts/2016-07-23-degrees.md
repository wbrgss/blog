title: Education & renumeration
subtitle: Out of all academic fields, does STEM have the king ROI?
---

As university education becomes increasingly commoditized, freshmen inevitably seek out majors with better employment prospects. But unlike most commodities, paying for an education doesn't guarantee a return. Education is more akin to a gym membership than purchasing a new car, requiring hard work and the right program, in addition to money, to produce a tangible "product."

People with the right combination of passion, skill, and luck can theoretically succeed in any career field, with or without an education. Dropping out to start a business, or pursuing a trade immediately after secondary school, both have their upsides. However, recent data shows that a overwhelming majority of American high school graduates (69.2%){% sidenote side1 [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/hsgec.nr0.htm "Post-Secondary Enrollment") %} enter college or university. The economic benefits of enrolling (and downsides of choosing not to) are a large factor.{% sidenote side2 [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/ "Post-Secondary Enrollment") %}

Differential tuition (a model where tuition is priced relative to the cost to provide a program) at American universities has been on the rise.{% sidenote side3 [Cornell Higher Education Research Institute](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/ilr.cornell.edu/files/2011%20Survey%20of%20Differential%20Tuition%20at%20Public%20Higher%20Education%20Institutions.pdf "Survey of Differential Tuition at Public Higher Education Institutions") (PDF) %} Still, a majority of undergraduate institutions have a uniform tuition model, and the upfront cost of relatively pricier majors in differential models is nevertheless incommensurate with their often lucrative future earning potential. Thus students looking for a good job upon graduation naturally try to get the most bang for their buck.

High school students with choices set before them receive "common sense" advice to pursue STEM degrees. Many students who are smart enough to qualify for university are unable to reconcile platitudes to the tune of "just be yourself" and "follow your passion" with the climate of alarmist anecdotes about graduates with careers in sandwich artistry.

As a result, STEM enrollment is increasing.{% sidenote side4 [*Science* Insider](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/06/data-check-us-producing-more-stem-graduates-even-without-proposed-initiatives "STEM graduates") %} Yet, for students who would otherwise be bored to tears by requirements such as calculus and circuit logic force themselves to slog through the material, motivated by money. Many fail. The ones who succeed may find themselves diving headfirst into competitive yet lucrative industries, and the truly lucky ones are given opportunities to pursue world-changing technological developments.

And so the revenge of the nerds is finally upon us—young people with numerical aptitude are generally more well-off than their arts degree peers. Is the third group—STEM students who lack the natural talent and passion of their classmates—simply greedy? Not really. If not passion, they must be motivated by money—but such students are simply trying to make a living, squeezed out by an economy that overvalues blue chips and undervalues blue collars.

Many STEM programs have high dropout rates.{% sidenote side5 [Journal of Technology and Science Education](http://www.jotse.org/index.php/jotse/article/download/136/150 "Stem Attrition Among High-performing College Students In The United States: Scope And Potential Causes") (PDF) %} More difficult grading is one reason.{% sidenote side6 [Cornell University](http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2010/04/tougher-grading-one-reason-high-stem-dropout-rate "Tougher grading is one reason for high STEM dropout rate") %} But it's ignorant to blame low-performing students for their inability to succeed in such programs; many of those otherwise unsuited or uninterested in STEM fields enter them out of desperation. Careers in such areas are not merely a lucrative bet, a necessarily safe one. Such is the disparity between soft sciences and liberal arts and STEM degrees' return on investment.

Such thinking may be sensible, but it is hardly sustainable. Workplace variety and meritocracy was one of the juicier promises of 20th century capitalism; a brief American dream sandwiched between a dusk of nepotism and the dawn of futurism. The natural connection between squeezed industries, increasing automation, and demand for STEM skills makes many young people anxious, and yet some (the nerds who benefit) welcome our forthcoming job-stealing robot overlords. Still, we live in awkward times—what do the people not creating artificial intelligence do while they wait for the [singularity](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/tech/2014/11/artificial-intelligence-singularity-theory)?

The idea of universal basic income has been [suggested](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/technology/plan-to-fight-robot-invasion-at-work-give-everyone-a-paycheck.html) by some, but the idea is impractically premature in such a technological purgatory. We are on perhaps on the cusp of a machine-sustained utopia, but cusps are notoriously unstable foundations. Universal basic income also completely undermines the existential underpinnings of modern life. Minimum-wage workers in poverty, temporarily embarrassed millionaires, and the top 1% all find meaning in the pursuit of capital: providing for one's family, a metric of personal achievement, or simply greed. And socialist leaders want to simply give us money, no strings attached? Who are they to dash our aspirations of wealth?

With income or without, human beings need to be occupied in order to be happy. Students passionate about STEM are the lucky ones—they can reasonably expect to get paid to do what they love, while increasingly the best their peers in other programs can hope for is to get paid, period. If you are one of the latter, it is in your best interest to consider how to thread the needle of gainful employment, achieving both career fulfillment and financial independence. Millenials may have been born too late to explore the earth, and too early to explore the galaxy, but just in time to explore their own career motivations. That, at least, is a modern luxury.
