<!--           <section itemprop="description">
            <p>The sexual revolution of the 1960s was supposedly an era of free love. But, according to the millenial media, its contemporary equivalent—hookup culture—is decidedly loveless. The two terms describe essentially the same trend of promiscuity (or sexual liberation, to give it an ideological spin). Yet while free love connotes silly, slutty bohemians engaged in harmless rebellion, “hookup culture” shares the same negative space as its evil twin, “rape culture,” or even “consumer culture” and “gun culture.” At face value, such vitriolic phrases are more evocative of bacteria than civil society.</p>

<p>In two generations, sexual freedom has come full circle. Millenials, much like their parents, convince themselves that detached sex works for them. Its upsides include freedom, choice, and potentially steamy encounters–at the expense of security, love, and inevitably lukewarm ones. Unlike the first sexual revolution, however, modern sexual relationships are better described as a devolution.</p>

<p>“Free love” is a phrased tinged with nostalgic, rosy retrospection. In hindsight, the boomers’ liberal sexual attitudes brought widespread STDs and divorce. But at least it had a purpose. More ideologically-minded hippies were fucking each other and the system at the same time, forcing a cultural shift that rejected the repressive gender roles and stifiling societal expectations of the 1950s. These libertines, at the very least, pursued an lifestyle that combined hedonism with optimism. They saw the stable yet boring lives of their parents and asked themselves “is this it”?</p>

<p>The same question is now being asked by the baby boomers’ babies—the natural consequences of all their parents’ lovemaking. Their ennui is now caused by abundance of choice, rather than the restrictive society their parents fought against. That, and apathy so pervasive that not only they have to worry about catching STDs, but feelings as well. The only way to prevent such an affliction is emotional detachment.</p>

<p>For many in this generation, love is a four-letter word; an embarrasing or undesirable side-effect of sex. But despite moral panic over wayward millenials, at least one <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-016-0798-z">contemporary study</a> has found that 15% of millenial Americans 20-24 are virgins, compared to 6% in 1969. They also have fewer and more delayed marriages, and higher divorce rates.</p>

<p>Two of the most pessimistic, and also most discussed, investigations of hookup culture include <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s “<a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating">Tinder and the Dawn of the Dating Apocalypse</a>” and <em>The Atlantic</em>’s “<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/09/boys-on-the-side/309062/">Boys on the Side</a>.” Despite their attention-grabbing headlines, however, neither the cynicism of the <em>Vanity Fair</em> article nor the detached acceptance of the <em>Atlantic</em>’s piece capture the full picture.</p>

<p>The same magazine that published “Boys on the Side,” in 2012, also published the remarkably insightful “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1959/11/sex-and-the-college-girl/305753/">Sex and the College Girl</a>”, by author Nora Johnson, 55 years earlier. Johnson’s take on 1957 dating culture and its downsides foreshadows a full-blown sexual revolution just a few years later.  She writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Promiscuity […] demands a certain amount of nerve. It might be misdirected nerve, or neurotic nerve, or a nerve born of defiance or ignorance or of an intellectual disregard of social mores, but that’s what it takes. Sleeping around is a risky business, emotionally, physically, and morally, and this is no light undertaking. I have never really understood why it is considered to be so easy for girls to say yes, particularly to four different men over a period of two weeks. On the other hand, it is very easy to go steady. Everybody is doing it [….] The depressing aspect of this perpetual twosome is that it is so often based on sex and convenience.</p>
  <p class="footer"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Johnson, much like the “Boys on the Side” girls, is slightly disturbed by her observations on dating culture, in an era where people actually went on dates. She struggles with the choice between going steady with a safe choice, avoiding the anxiety of singlehood, and taking up the “risky business” of a more liberal perspective. Ironically, Johnson’s male peers are keen to tie girls down in order to have sex with them, where she is more inclined to shop around, with or without sex, before choosing a long-term mate. Now it’s modern men are stereotypically more likely to and weigh their options, and avoid commitment, because it’s much less commonly necessary for a physical relationship.</p>

<p>Johnson felt that young people were simultaneously too promiscuous and getting married too early. After all, one can date without sex as well as vice versa. Johnson speaks of the generation before her, in the “Jazz Age,” whose “gay irresponsibility is our heritage.” Such hedonism, she says, didn’t set a good example. The Jazz Age parents could “not very well forbid adventurousness, nor [could] they take a very stalwart attitude about sex.” Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Millenials’ parents, rather, worry that they are getting married too late, or not at all. Who can blame them? In the end, much like their parents before them, all they can do is hope their children learn from their experience. Nebulous expectations and dating conventions make it difficult to predict what a partner wants, even once you’ve got it figured out yourself. And even once a couple is on the same page, the spectre of divorce looms, as it did for the boomers who normalized it. Still, as they grow up, millenials will surely attempt to compromise, settling down just as their less liberated ancestors have done for centuries.</p>

            <p>As university education becomes increasingly commoditized, freshmen inevitably seek out majors with better employment prospects. But unlike most commodities, paying for an education doesn’t guarantee a return. Education is more akin to a gym membership than purchasing a new car, requiring hard work and the right program, in addition to money, to produce a tangible “product.”</p>

<p>People with the right combination of passion, skill, and luck can theoretically succeed in any career field, with or without an education. Dropping out to start a business, or pursuing a trade immediately after secondary school, both have their upsides. However, recent data shows that a overwhelming majority of American high school graduates (69.2%)<span id="side1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote"><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/hsgec.nr0.htm" title="Post-Secondary Enrollment">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></span> enter college or university. The economic benefits of enrolling (and downsides of choosing not to) are a large factor.<span id="side2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>

<p>Differential tuition (a model where tuition is priced relative to the cost to provide a program) at American universities has been on the rise.<span id="side3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/ilr.cornell.edu/files/2011%20Survey%20of%20Differential%20Tuition%20at%20Public%20Higher%20Education%20Institutions.pdf" title="Survey of Differential Tuition at Public Higher Education Institutions">Cornell Higher Education Research Institute</a> (PDF)</span> Still, a majority of undergraduate institutions have a uniform tuition model, and the upfront cost of relatively pricier majors in differential models is nevertheless incommensurate with their often lucrative future earning potential. Thus students looking for a good job upon graduation naturally try to get the most bang for their buck.</p>

<p>High school students with choices set before them receive “common sense” advice to pursue STEM degrees. Many students who are smart enough to qualify for university are unable to reconcile platitudes to the tune of “just be yourself” and “follow your passion” with the climate of alarmist anecdotes about graduates with careers in sandwich artistry.</p>

<p>As a result, STEM enrollment is increasing.<span id="side4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote"><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/06/data-check-us-producing-more-stem-graduates-even-without-proposed-initiatives" title="STEM graduates"><em>Science</em> Insider</a></span> Yet, for students who would otherwise be bored to tears by requirements such as calculus and circuit logic force themselves to slog through the material, motivated by money. Many fail. The ones who succeed may find themselves diving headfirst into competitive yet lucrative industries, and the truly lucky ones are given opportunities to pursue world-changing technological developments.</p>

<p>And so the revenge of the nerds is finally upon us—young people with numerical aptitude are generally more well-off than their arts degree peers. Is the third group—STEM students who lack the natural talent and passion of their classmates—simply greedy? Not really. If not passion, they must be motivated by money—but such students are simply trying to make a living, squeezed out by an economy that overvalues blue chips and undervalues blue collars.</p>

<p>Many STEM programs have high dropout rates.<span id="side5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote"><a href="http://www.jotse.org/index.php/jotse/article/download/136/150" title="Stem Attrition Among High-performing College Students In The United States: Scope And Potential Causes">Journal of Technology and Science Education</a> (PDF)</span> More difficult grading is one reason.<span id="side6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote"><a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2010/04/tougher-grading-one-reason-high-stem-dropout-rate" title="Tougher grading is one reason for high STEM dropout rate">Cornell University</a></span> But it’s ignorant to blame low-performing students for their inability to succeed in such programs; many of those otherwise unsuited or uninterested in STEM fields enter them out of desperation. Careers in such areas are not merely a lucrative bet, a necessarily safe one. Such is the disparity between soft sciences and liberal arts and STEM degrees’ return on investment.</p>

<p>Such thinking may be sensible, but it is hardly sustainable. Workplace variety and meritocracy was one of the juicier promises of 20th century capitalism; a brief American dream sandwiched between a dusk of nepotism and the dawn of futurism. The natural connection between squeezed industries, increasing automation, and demand for STEM skills makes many young people anxious, and yet some (the nerds who benefit) welcome our forthcoming job-stealing robot overlords. Still, we live in awkward times—what do the people not creating artificial intelligence do while they wait for the <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/tech/2014/11/artificial-intelligence-singularity-theory">singularity</a>?</p>

<p>The idea of universal basic income has been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/technology/plan-to-fight-robot-invasion-at-work-give-everyone-a-paycheck.html">suggested</a> by some, but the idea is impractically premature in such a technological purgatory. We are on perhaps on the cusp of a machine-sustained utopia, but cusps are notoriously unstable foundations. Universal basic income also completely undermines the existential underpinnings of modern life. Minimum-wage workers in poverty, temporarily embarrassed millionaires, and the top 1% all find meaning in the pursuit of capital: providing for one’s family, a metric of personal achievement, or simply greed. And socialist leaders want to simply give us money, no strings attached? Who are they to dash our aspirations of wealth?</p>

<p>With income or without, human beings need to be occupied in order to be happy. Students passionate about STEM are the lucky ones—they can reasonably expect to get paid to do what they love, while increasingly the best their peers in other programs can hope for is to get paid, period. If you are one of the latter, it is in your best interest to consider how to thread the needle of gainful employment, achieving both career fulfillment and financial independence. Millenials may have been born too late to explore the earth, and too early to explore the galaxy, but just in time to explore their own career motivations. That, at least, is a modern luxury.</p>

            <p>“We are all Satoshi.” So claims an email posted to the bitcoin developer mailing list, from an address that—at least at one point—belonged to the enigmatic founder of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. The email was evidently a response to Australian computer scientist Craig Wright’s announcement that he was Nakamoto, a claim which was immediately disputed and now widely regarded as false. Wright’s evidence was not sufficient. Will the real Satoshi please stand up? And if he does, what would be required from him in order to satisfy skeptics?</p>

<p>Dr. Wright’s proof consisted of two pieces of evidence. The first was a blog post that included an arbitrarily chosen text written by Jean-Paul Sartre, signed using a “private key” from an early bitcoin transaction and therefore likely held by Nakamoto exclusively. The signature can be verified using a “public key” associated with Nakamoto. The problem arises when attempting to confirm that it matches the encrypted Sartre speech that Wright chose; the match cannot be cryptographically validated. Later, a Reddit user discovered that the signed text was not Sartre at all, but the “hashed” record of a publicly available transaction conducted by Nakamoto—the equivalent of a receipt. It was as if Wright cut a signature from that receipt and pasted it onto a random document. The second piece of evidence is more unclear. Wright, in a private live demonstration, signed a message chosen by lead bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen using a signature from the first “block” of generated bitcoins that Nakamoto is very likely to have produced. Andresen believed (and perhaps still does) that Wright is Nakamoto—but the only proof is his word. During a recent bitcoin conference during which Andresen explained his convictions, bitcoin entrepreneur Vitalik Buterin interjected with an Occam’s Razor argument:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Signalling theory says if you have a good way of proving something and a noisy way of proving something, and you choose the noisy way…it’s because you couldn’t do the good way in the first place.</p>
  <p class="footer"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several ways that the genuine Nakamoto could identify himself, but two stand out as more resilient to scrutiny. One would be signing a message, or several, with the same private keys linked with the recipient of the earliest bitcoins, presumably Nakamoto. This was the method of Dr. Wright’s choice, but his process was anything but transparent. Publicly signing a message stating, “I, _____, am Satoshi Nakamoto” would be far more effective—Litecoin (a bitcoin offshoot) developer Charlie Lee presented such a proof, posting a single cryptographically verifiable screenshot on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here’s my proof. Simple. No need to have a proof ceremony and a long blog post.<a href="https://t.co/icmGGTKPsZ">https://t.co/icmGGTKPsZ</a></p>
  <p>— Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) <a href="https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/727157971428331520">May 2, 2016</a></p>
</blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Another is to simply spend some ancient coins. Nakamoto likely possesses around 1 million original bitcoin (approximately $456 million), and moving some of the 50 coins from bitcoin’s initial “genesis block,” along with an announcement, would constitute fairly solid evidence. But it is unknown whether he owns the coins for sure, and the fact that they have remained untouched, despite a significant financial incentive to sell them, is telling.</p>

<p>If Nakamoto has not lost the original coins, there may be an ideological reason for keeping them to himself. Some bitcoin proponents hold that identifying the currency’s inventor runs counter to the principles of libertarianism and decentralization connected with it. The fact that Andresen’s access to the bitcoin codebase was revoked by other bitcoin developers—under the assumption he was hacked—soon after Andresen vouched for Dr. Wright lends credence to the theory that Nakamoto’s true identity is a closely guarded secret. And therein lies the catch—given Satoshi Nakamoto’s reputation as a reclusive ideologue, any prospective Satoshi seeking their 15 minutes of fame will inevitably face suspicion.</p>
