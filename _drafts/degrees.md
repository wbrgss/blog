## In search of the king ROI in education

As university education is increasingly commoditized, it's inevitable that freshmen seek out a curriculum that best secures their chances of gainful employment immediately upon graduation. Of course, university is different than most commodities in that simply coughing up the funds won't guarantee a return. An decent education is more akin to a gym membership than a brand new car, providing the tools for self-development but not guaranteeing a result without hard work.

People with the right combination of passion, skill, and luck can theoretically succeed in any field, with or without an education. Going full-tilt into esoteric academia, or pursuing a trade immediately after high school both have their pros and cons. However, recent data shows that a overwhelming majority of American high school graduates (69.2%){% sidenote side1 Source: [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/hsgec.nr0.htm "Post-Secondary Enrollment") %} elect to enroll in a college in university soon after, many, at least, in part, for economic benefits.{% sidenote side2 See [The Rising Cost of Not Going to College (Pew Research Center)](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/ "Post-Secondary Enrollment") %}.

Differential tuition (a model where tuition is priced relative to the cost to provide a program) at American universities has been increasing in popularity.{% sidenote side3 Source: [Cornell Higher Education Research Institute](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/ilr.cornell.edu/files/2011%20Survey%20of%20Differential%20Tuition%20at%20Public%20Higher%20Education%20Institutions.pdf) "Survey of Differential Tuition at Public Higher Education Institutions") %} Still, a majority of undergraduate institutions still have a uniform tuition model for all majors, and the upfront cost relatively pricier majors is nevertheless incommesurate with thier sometimes lucrative future earning potential. Thus students looking for a good job upon graduation naturally try to get the most bang out of their buck.

High school students with choices set before them receive "common sense" advice that they should pursue STEM degrees, or, to a somewhat lesser extent, degrees in business and finance. Many students who are smart enough to qualify for university are unable to reconcile platitudes to the tune of "just be yourself" and "follow your passion" with the zeitgeist (**climate?**) of alarmist anecdotes about graduates with careers in sandwich artistry.

As a result, STEM enrollment is at an all time high (cite). Yet, for students who would otherwise be bored to tears by requirements such as calculus and circuit logic force themselves to slog through the material, motivated by money. Many fail. The ones who succeed may find themselves diving headfirst into competitive yet lucrative indistries, and the truly lucky ones are given oppurtunities to pursue world-changing technolical developments. 

Thus the revenge of the nerds is finally upon us—young people with numerical aptitude find themselves ahead of their peers socioeconomically. Are the others—STEM students who lack the natural devotion of their peers to their field—simply greedy? Not really. Students who dislike school are simply trying to make a living; squeezed out by an economy that allowed the less academically inclined to make an honest living in blue collar work.
