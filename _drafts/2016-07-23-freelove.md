subtitle: The best things in life are free?

Did hippies catch feelings? The sexual revolution of the 1960s was supposedly an era of free love. But, according to the millenial media, its contemporary equivalent—hookup culture—is [decidedly loveless](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating). The two terms describe essentially the same "trend" of promiscuity (or sexual liberation, to give it an ideological spin). Yet while free love connotes silly, slutty bohemians engaged in harmless rebellion, "hookup culture" shares the same negative space as its evil twin, "rape culture," or even "consumer culture" and "gun culture." At face value, such vitriolic phrases evoke bacteria more than civil society.
