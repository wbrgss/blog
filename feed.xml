          <description>&lt;p&gt;“We are all Satoshi.” So claims an email posted to the bitcoin developer mailing list, from an address that—at least at one point—belonged to the enigmatic founder of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. The email was evidently a response to Australian computer scientist Craig Wright’s announcement that he was Nakamoto, a claim which was immediately disputed and now widely regarded as false. Wright’s evidence was not sufficient. Will the real Satoshi please stand up? And if he does, what would be required from him in order to satisfy skeptics?&lt;/p&gt;
